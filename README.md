# tic-tac-toe
Tic-Tac-Toe game.

## Instructions
- Implement a single-player version of the game Tic-Tac-Toe against any kind of AI or
random moves.
- Spec: https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/tic-tac-toe-game-rules-412170
- Visualization: Text or ASCII art is fine, bonus points for graphics in Unity3D.

## TODO:
- Draw board
- Allow to click buttons
- Buttons selected will create an `x`
- Create random move mode
- Check if game is complete (3 in a row or if no more moves can be played)
- Unit tests
- Always start with `x`.
- Switch to `o` on next turn
- Create simple player
- Create ability to expand board based on selection (meaning, default to `3x3`, but select more `4x4`, `5x5`, etc.)
- Create impossible AI
- Create in Unity3D
- Make sure to review the requirements and spec before turning in
- Beef up the README.md
